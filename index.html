			<h1>Floats</h1>
				<img id="floatImg" src="./img/floats.jpg" alt="floats">
					<p>
						I have had trouble with floats since I started with Design for Web Standards 1. I am getting better with them
						but most of the time they end up being pushed down or overlap another element. This class will help me with
						learning how to get a better handle on my floats. This is something that is definitely needed within the Web
						Design and Development career. I will post my progress as updates come available with screen shots.
					</p>
			<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How I plan to accomplish this:</h2>
				<p id="accomplish">
					I plan to accomplish this by working with my css better. Below is an example of one of my messed up floats.
					<img src="./img/rsz_screen_shot_2015-11-01_at_40345_pm.jpg" alt="bad float">
					The way I plan on fixing that is to work on my clear tags and knowing which way to float them.
					for instance:
					Here is a float tag from www.w3schools.com<br/><br/>
					<img id="floatTag" src="./img/Screen%20Shot%202015-11-01%20at%204.00.49%20PM.png" alt="float tag">

			<h1> Gallery </h1>
				<img src="./img/gallery.jpg" alt="gallery">
					<p>
						While I can use frameworks to get a gallery of photots, I want to better my skills at setting
						them up without having to use the framework. I want to know the code by heart or at least have
						 it saved in a folder somewhere to reference it when I want to use this function. I will post my
						progress as updates come available with screen shots.

			<h1> Animation </h1>
				<img src="./img/animation.jpg" alt="Animation">
					<p>
						I know what you're thinking. "Randall, this is javaScript based!" I know, but I still have to
						know the HTML and CSS behind it to actually make it function.I will post my progress as updates
						come available with screen shots.

		<article id="orbiter">
			<h1> Orbiters </h1>
				<img src="./img/orbiter.jpg" alt="Orbiter">
					<p>
						You're probably thinking "What is it with javaScript and this guy?" Well, although this may be
						mostly JS based, I still have to know the CSS and HTML behind it to amke it work. Just like I
						said with the animation entry, I want to be able to recall it from memory or a file. I will post
						my progress as updates come available with screen shots.

			<h1> Dropdown Menus </h1>
			<img src="./img/DropDown.jpg" alt="Dropdown">
			<p>
				Finally for this week, the last thing I want to better is Drop Down Menus. They can look
				<strong>AWESOME</strong> when done correctly. Some that I have done looks like someone in middle school
				created them. I want to better my skills with them. Every website needs navigation so without it you
				aren't going to get anywhere. I will post my progress as updates come available with screen shots.
